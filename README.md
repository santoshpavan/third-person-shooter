# Third Person Shooter
A third person shooter being build on (as a hobby) on top of the Unity Third Person Character Controller ([store asset link](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/starter-assets-third-person-character-controller-196526)).

The video from [CodeMonkey](https://youtu.be/FbM4CkqtOuA) helped me get started with things.

## Project Status

### Animations

1. Added the animations for shooting stance. But the jump animations are iffy, especially the landing animation. Feet doesn't stay on the ground.
